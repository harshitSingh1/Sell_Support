## Introduction

This project "Sell-Support" aims to help new shops enter the market or existing shops that do not know their customers' exact demands. Some businesses conduct online paid surveys like "Swagbucks" to gather customer feedback, but this website allows shopkeepers to collect product ratings and feedback for free. Some people are very busy with household or office work and do not have time for regular shopping, so they prefer online shopping. Therefore, we have added features such as top products, pre-booking, live chat, and borrowing loans to improve offline businesses on our website. With these features, customers can chat with the shopkeeper and inquire about the availability of items on their shopping list. If the shop has the item, the customer can buy it immediately or pre-book it. This saves the customer time and effort in searching for items in the market. Additionally, the feedback and rating system allows the shopkeeper to improve the quality of their products and know which items are in high demand.

## Proposed System
In today's market, small businesses face a number of difficulties, particularly when trying to compete with bigger, more well-known brands. The biggest challenge they have is staying current with technology and industry changes. It has become more difficult for small, offline businesses to engage with their target audience and offer sufficient customer assistance as a result of the growth of e-commerce and online marketplaces. We created Sell-Support, a software that tries to give small companies a solution to deal with these problems, in response to this difficulty.

Sell-Support aims to reduce the problems that small offline businesses have with organization, customer service, and growing market competition. The system seeks to give businesses a more effective and beneficial approach for engaging with their target customer while saving their time and money.

## Main Targets
